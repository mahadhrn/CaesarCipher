# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption (Plain JavaScript)

A lightweight, fully functional implementation of **Caesar Cipher** built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no dependencies.  
It allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text messages or `.txt` files using a simple shift key logic.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Client-side only (no backend required)**  
✅ **File upload support (.txt)** – automatically reads content for encryption/decryption  
✅ **File download** – saves the encrypted/decrypted message as `.txt`  
✅ **Responsive, modern UI** with a styled interface  
✅ **Instant encryption and decryption** using ASCII shift logic

## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a basic **substitution cipher** where each character in the plaintext is shifted by a given integer key.
